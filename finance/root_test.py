# Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, & Shin, 1992). 
# In this test, the null hypothesis is that the data are stationary, 
# and we look for evidence that the null hypothesis is false.

# A key difference from ADF test is the null hypothesis of the KPSS test is that the series is stationary.
# So practically, the interpretaion of p-value is just the opposite to each other.

# The test statistic should be smaller
